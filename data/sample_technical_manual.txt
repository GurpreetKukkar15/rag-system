# Technical Manual: RAG System Implementation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for document-based question answering.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Document Ingestion
The document ingestion process involves several key steps:
- Loading PDF documents from the data directory
- Splitting documents into manageable chunks
- Creating vector embeddings using sentence transformers
- Storing embeddings in a FAISS vector database

### 2. Text Processing
Text processing is crucial for effective retrieval:
- Use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for optimal chunking
- Maintain chunk overlap to preserve context
- Set appropriate chunk size (typically 1000 characters)
- Ensure chunks are semantically meaningful

### 3. Vector Database
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) provides efficient similarity search:
- Supports both CPU and GPU implementations
- Enables fast nearest neighbor search
- Scales well with large document collections
- Provides persistent storage capabilities

### 4. Embedding Models
Sentence transformers are ideal for RAG systems:
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2: Fast and efficient for most use cases
- all-mpnet-base-v2: Higher quality but slower
- Choose based on speed vs. accuracy requirements

## Implementation Best Practices

### Chunk Size Optimization
- Too small: Loses context and meaning
- Too large: Reduces retrieval precision
- Recommended: 500-1500 characters with 10-20% overlap

### Embedding Considerations
- Use consistent embedding model for training and inference
- Consider domain-specific models for specialized content
- Regular model updates may require re-indexing

### Performance Tuning
- Batch processing for large document collections
- Monitor memory usage during ingestion
- Implement progress tracking for long-running processes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Memory errors during large document processing
   - Solution: Process documents in smaller batches
   
2. Poor retrieval quality
   - Solution: Adjust chunk size and overlap parameters
   
3. Slow ingestion speed
   - Solution: Use GPU acceleration or optimize chunking strategy

### Error Handling
- Validate PDF file integrity before processing
- Implement retry logic for network-dependent operations
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring

## Conclusion
A well-implemented RAG system requires careful attention to document processing, embedding quality, and retrieval optimization. Following these guidelines will help ensure successful implementation and deployment.
