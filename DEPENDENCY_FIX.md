# 🔧 Dependency Conflict Fixed!

## ❌ The Problem
Vercel build was failing with:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement langchain-core==0.1.0
ERROR: ResolutionImpossible
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
- `langchain==0.1.0` requires `langchain-core>=0.1.7,<0.2`
- But we had `langchain-core==0.1.0` (too old)
- This created a dependency conflict that pip couldn't resolve

## ✅ The Fix
Updated `requirements.txt`:
```diff
- langchain-core==0.1.0
+ langchain-core>=0.1.7,<0.2
```

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Vercel will auto-redeploy** with the latest commit
2. **Build should now succeed** - no more dependency conflicts
3. **System will be live** at your Vercel URL

## 📊 What's Working Now
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All compatible versions
- ✅ **FAISS**: Version 1.12.0 (Python 3.12 compatible)
- ✅ **LangChain**: Proper version constraints
- ✅ **Vercel**: Should build successfully

## 🎯 Expected Result
Your RAG system should now deploy successfully on Vercel with:
- Document upload functionality
- FAISS vector search
- Database tracking
- Web interface
- Simplified responses (no Ollama on Vercel)

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Ready for Vercel deployment!
